# MERN-book-search

Welcome to the MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine! This project is a demonstration of your skills in transforming a fully functional Google Books API search engine, originally built with a RESTful API, into a more efficient GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The application utilizes the MERN stack, featuring a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Additionally, users can save their book searches to the backend.

## Challenge Objectives

To successfully complete this challenge, follow these key objectives:

1. **Set up Apollo Server for GraphQL:**
   Transform the existing RESTful API into a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. Utilize GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data effectively.

2. **Adapt Authentication Middleware:**
   Modify the existing authentication middleware to seamlessly function within the context of a GraphQL API. Ensure that security measures are maintained throughout the transition.

3. **Implement Apollo Provider:**
   Create an Apollo Provider to facilitate communication between the frontend and the Apollo Server. This ensures smooth and efficient data flow for GraphQL queries and mutations.

4. **Deployment on Render:**
   Deploy the entire application on the Render platform. Ensure that all components work seamlessly in the production environment.


## Deployed Link

## Getting Started

To begin working on the challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies for both the server and client:
   ```bash
   cd book-search-engine
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up MongoDB:**
   Ensure that you have a MongoDB database ready. Update the connection string in the server's configuration to point to your database.

4. **Start the Application:**
   Run the following command to start both the server and the client:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Challenge Completion

Once you have successfully implemented all the objectives, your Book Search Engine will be optimized for GraphQL and ready for deployment on Render. Share your achievements and showcase your GraphQL skills!

## Deployment on Render
